# Auto_Thermocouple
 Now, we have three ways to get the temperature of the thermocouple(MAX6675). The data will be stored on a memory card. The LCD displays the current temperature in real-time.   
 Subfolders contain separate programs for the three measurement methods.   
 Use Auto_Thermocouple.ino test your device.
